         makes a move every 6 seconds. The side that forms 10 words first wins the match. The words which are common
         between both the sides are not counted.<br/><br/>For the 4-letters+ word setting
         the timeout period is two and half minutes and the computer chips in a word every 15 seconds.
         <br/><br/>The winner is decided by the number of words.
         If both the players have equal number of words (after subtracting the common ones) the match is drawn.<br/><br/>The
